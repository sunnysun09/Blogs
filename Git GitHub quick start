Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
GitHub is a cloud based platform built around the Git tool; it is a web-based hosting service that stores 
code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool. 

To use Git/GitHub:
  1. Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
  2. Create a GitHub account
  3. Initialize a local repository or clone a resository from GitHub:
       initialize local repository:  
           git init .
       clone a repository
           git clone <repository_url>

  4. Start to work on the repository:
    config editor for easy usage:
        git config --global core.editor <your app's name>
    check files status:        git status
    add files to repository:   git add <file(s)> 
    commit files:              git commit
    check file difference:     git diff
    check file commit history: git log

  5. Push the commit in the branch to GitHub repository:
       git push origin <my-new-branch>
    If there is only master branch, "git push" cmd should be enough.
   
  6. Create a Pull Request (PR) from GitHub to allow your pushed code to be reviewed and approval for merge.
  
  7. Merge the PR to master branch from GitHub.
  
  8. Update your local files from the repository:
       git pull origin master


If use Eclipse, install git in eclipse plugin (EGit) and you can do all the git cmds from Eclipse.
